# BotConfig with JSON DataStorage

## What is it

This is a simple example of how you can use JSON to store a bot config as-well as fully functioning DataStorage class to Retrieve or Store (Overwrite) a BotConfig.json file.

**NOTE:** This is not meant to be a copy/paste example. While this will work, it's intention is to guide you on how you can create your own.
